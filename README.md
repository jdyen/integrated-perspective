This repository contains an R script and collated data to run the analysis presented in Yen et al. (submitted) Integrating multiple data types to connect ecological theory and data among levels.

The analysis requires the `integrated` R package. You can install this package from GitHub using the devtools package:
``` r
devtools::install_github('jdyen/integrated.pkg')
```
The `integrated` packages uses the `greta` R package, which you can read all about [here](https://greta-dev.github.io/greta/index.html).

Data are provided here for purposes of reproducibility. Raw data suitable for different analyses are publicly assessible through the [Victorian Biodiversity Atlas](https://vba.dse.vic.gov.au/vba/).
